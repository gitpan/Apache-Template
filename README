NAME
    Apache::Template - Apache/mod_perl interface to the Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
        # add the following to your httpd.conf
        PerlModule          Apache::Template

        # set various configuration options, e.g.
        TT2Trim             On
        TT2PostChomp        On
        TT2EvalPerl         On
        TT2IncludePath      /usr/local/tt2/templates
        TT2IncludePath      /home/abw/tt2/lib
        TT2PreProcess       config header
        TT2PostProcess      footer
        TT2Error            error

        # now define Apache::Template as a PerlHandler, e.g.
        <Files *.tt2>
            SetHandler      perl-script
            PerlHandler     Apache::Template
        </Files>

        <Location /tt2>
            SetHandler      perl-script
            PerlHandler     Apache::Template
        </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    The Apache::Template module provides a simple interface to the Template
    Toolkit from Apache/mod_perl. The Template Toolkit is a fast, powerful
    and extensible template processing system written in Perl. It implements
    a general purpose template language which allows you to clearly separate
    application logic, data and presentation elements. It boasts numerous
    features to facilitate in the generation of web content both online and
    offline in "batch mode".

    The documentation (see the Apache::Template manpage) describes the
    Apache::Template module, concerning itself primarily with the
    Apache/mod_perl configuration options (e.g. the httpd.conf side of
    things) and not going into any great depth about the Template Toolkit
    itself. The Template Toolkit includes copious documentation which
    already covers these things in great detail. See the Template manpage
    for further information.

OBTAINING AND INSTALLING Apache::Template
    The Apache::Template module requires the Template Toolkit version 2.00.
    This can be downloaded from any CPAN site:

        http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Template/

    This should be installed according to the instructions in the README
    file that accompanies it.

    The latest release version of Apache::Template can be downloaded from
    any CPAN site:

        http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Apache/

    Apache::Template is distributed as a gzipped tar archive file:

        Apache-Template-<version>.tar.gz

    where <version> represents the current version number, e.g. 0.02

    To install the Apache::Template module, unpack the distribution archive
    to create an installation directory. Something like this:

        tar zxf Apache-Template-0.02.tar.gz
    or
        gunzip Apache-Template-0.02.tar.gz
        tar xf Apache-Template-0.02.tar

    You can then 'cd' into the directory created,

        cd Apache-Template-2.00

    and perform the usual Perl installation procedure:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
